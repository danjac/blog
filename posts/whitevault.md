[The White Vault](http://thewhitevault.com/) is a horror/scifi podcast from [Fool and Scholar](https://foolandscholar.com/).

The first season takes place on the Arctic island of Svalbard, where a team sent to investigate a remote outpost discover an ancient site with an horrific secret. The second season brings us to a cave in the Andes and the third returns to Svalbard. The investigations are financed by a mysterious woman whose family has links to an ancient global conspiracy...

I can't say too much about *The White Vault* without giving away spoilers, but if Lovecraftian horror and scifi are your jam you'll love it. The voice acting and sound effects are top notch, with tight pacing and suspense throughout. Fool and Scholar have also produced additional paid content I might treat myself to once the current season is finished.
