In [previous](/posts/dokku) [posts](/posts/starting-docker-file) I talked about [Dokku](https://dokku.com), a self-hosted Platform as a Service (PAAS) solution that you can run on Hetzner.

This is a great solution for a single developer, when you want to launch a hobby side project or small business and you don't have a big budget. Here I go through the steps to launching your own micro-PAAS in just 15-20 minutes!

## Prep

For our example, we are going to deploy a Django application, `photogram`. We are going to host our site on the domain `photogram.com`.

To make this project "Dokku-aware" you should have at least an `app.json` and a `Procfile`. For a bare minimum example our `app.json` file looks like this:

```json
  {
      "name": "My little SAAS",
      "formation": {
          "web": {
              "quantity": 1
          }
      },
  }
```

and the `Procfile`:

```
  release: ./release.sh
  web: gunicorn -c ./gunicorn.conf.py
```

If you have used Heroku, the `Procfile` should be familiar.

The release process, which is triggered on each deployment, points to a `release.sh` file that runs migrations, does some system checks etc:

```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  set -o errexit

  ./manage.py check --deploy

  ./manage.py migrate

  ./manage.py clear_cache
```

I like to point `gunicorn` at a Python module:


```python
  import multiprocessing

  # https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/configure.html#configuration-file

  wsgi_app = "project.wsgi"

  accesslog = "-"

  workers = multiprocessing.cpu_count() * 2 + 1
```

The neat thing about using a Python module instead of a config file or command line options is that you can calculate some things dynamically, e.g. the number of workers based on available CPU.

You can add more processes to your `app.json` and/or `Procfile` as needed, for example if you want to run celery, or schedule cron jobs. See the [Dokku](https://dokku.com) documentation for details.

I prefer to handle Dokku deployments using Docker rather than buildpacks. For details on building an optimal `Dockerfile` for Dokku deployments, see [my previous article](/posts/dokku).

## Create a Hetzner project

### Build your project

Once you have registered with Hetzner you can start a new project.

![Hetzner Dashboard](/img/hetzner_project.png)

The requirements depend on your project. For a typical Django-based application I go with the CPX11 or CX21 options:

* Ubuntu (22.04 as of writing)
* x86
* 2xCPU
* 4GB RAM
* 40GB SSD

This should cost around 5-6 EUR a month. You can scale up to more memory/CPU if needed or purchase a [volume]() if you need a much larger disk space (or just go with S3). You can also, for a little extra, make snapshots or add automated backups. Consult the Hetzner documentation for more information on this - for now we just want to get our site up and running.

Make sure to add your SSH key at this stage. Once you've created the project you can add the firewalls.

![SSH key](/img/hetzner_ssh_key.png)

### Add firewalls

You will need these firewalls:

#### Outbound

* SSH (Port 22)
* TCP (Port 80)
* TCP (Port 443)

#### Inbound

* TCP (Port 80)
* TCP (Port 443)

You can reuse this firewall configuration with multiple projects.

### Set up DNS

Next step is to set up DNS with Hetzner and map this to your domain registrar. I usually go with Namecheap but any provider should work fine as long as you can point your domain at the Hetzner nameservers.

The Hetzner DNS dashboard can be found at https://dns.hetzner.com/.

You will need to add at least one **A** record with the IP address of your project (shown in your project dashboard).

![Hetzner DNS](/img/hetzner_dns.png)

There should also be three **NS** (Nameserver) records included by default, these should be something like:

* helium.ns.hetzner.de.
* oxygen.ns.hetzner.com.
* hydrogen.ns.hetzner.com.

In your domain registrar (Namecheap in my case) you should have the option to set custom DNS. Add those three nameserver records.

Note that you can use the Hetzner DNS service for other needs, e.g. setting up email domains with Mailgun or some other service.

At this point, once the DNS caches have updated, you should be able to SSH into your new server (you should have your SSH key added to the project as noted earlier):

```bash
  ssh root@photogram.com
```

Now you are in the server, you can install Dokku.

## Set up Dokku

### Install Dokku

Once you are able to ssh into the server, you can install Dokku. This is just a couple commands:

```bash
  wget -NP . https://dokku.com/install/v0.32.3/bootstrap.sh
  sudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.32.3 bash bootstrap.sh
```

Check the correct stable version from the Dokku site: as of writing this is **v0.32.3**.

Installation will take a little while. It will not only install the Dokku runtime itself, but also add a `dokku` user and group.

Once installation is complete, you should add your SSH key to Dokku:

```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys | dokku ssh-keys:add admin
```
When you added your SSH key to the Hetzner project, it should have been added to the `authorized_keys` file.

This allows you to run Dokku commands remotely from your local terminal and deploy your repo, more of which later.

If you want to use some other SSH key you can do so with `dokku ssh-keys:add admin`, for example if you want to allow other developers to be able to access Dokku.

### Add plugins

Dokku has a number of plugins (and can even use some Heroku buildpacks). My typical Django project just needs three: PostgreSQL, Redis and LetsEncrypt. While still logged into the server, you can install these now:

```bash
  dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git
  dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-redis.git
  dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt.git
```

Once the plugins are installed, you can log out of the server. We will do the rest of the setup in your local terminal.

### Create your Dokku app

The next step is to create your Dokku app. For convenience, this should be the name of your repo, so in our case `photogram`.

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com apps:create photogram
```

Note a couple things:

1. We are running a Dokku command using the `dokku` user, **not** `root`.
2. When running remote commands under the `dokku` user, we don't need to add `dokku` before each command.

The command `apps:create` will create our app, but currently of course there is nothing there to run. Dokku might complain about this while running commands, but ignore it for now.

### Set up PostgreSQL

Next we need to create a PostgreSQL database and link it to our app.

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com postgres:create radiofeed
  ssh dokku@photogram.com postgres:link radiofeed radiofeed
```

This will automatically create a runtime environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. In your Django settings, you should therefore ensure that in production your database accesses this value from the environment. Parsing this into the `USER`, `NAME` and other db settings can be a pain, so using [dj_database_url](https://pypi.org/project/dj-database-url/) is recommended:

```python
import dj_database_url

DATABASES['default'] = dj_database_url.config(
    conn_max_age=600,
    conn_health_checks=True,
)
```

`dj_database_url.config` assumes the default `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

### Set up Redis

If your project is using Redis, for example for caching or as a Celery backend, the process is similar to PostgreSQL: create a database, then link it to your project:

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com redis:create radiofeed
  ssh dokku@photogram.com redis:link radiofeed radiofeed
```

Again, an environment variable `REDIS_URL` is automatically generated, which should be accessed in your production settings.

### Set up LetsEncrypt

In order to set up LetsEncrypt to provide SSL protection for your site, you first need to configure your domain with Dokku. By default a domain is created when you created the app, this will be something like `ubuntu-hel1.photogram.com`. Clear any default domains with this command:

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com domains:clear photogram
```

You can now link the domain you want to use with your app:

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com domains:add photogram phtogram.com
```

Now you can setup LetsEncrypt. First add your email address:

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com letsencrypt:set photogram email admin@photogram.com
```

Next enable Letsencrypt:

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com letsencrypt:enable photogram
```

This will automatically handle nginx configuration. If you want to set up auto-renewal:


```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com letsencrypt:auto-renew photogram
```

## Deploy your code

### Push your code to Dokku

Go to the top level of your repo in your local terminal. Once you have commmitted any changes you can now push to deploy:


```bash
  git checkout main
  git remote add dokku dokku@phtogram.com:photogram
  git push dokku main
```

If all goes well, your site should be deployed. If you are deploying with a Docker image, Dokku will build your image and deploy the container.

### Set environment variables

Next you will probably want to set some environment variables. As noted, some environment variables such as `DATABASE_URL` are set automatically so we should not touch those. Others you might want to set are:

* `SECRET_KEY`
* `ALLOWED_HOSTS` e.g. *photogram.com.*
* 3rd party credentials e.g. Sentry or Mailgun

To set a environment variable for example `SECRET_KEY`:

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com config:set --no-restart photogram SECRET_KEY=my_top_secret_key
```

The `--no-restart` flag will set the key without restarting the server: you might want to do this if setting a bunch of keys at the start. The environment variable will not take effect until you restart.

Once you are done you can restart the server without needing to deploy again with this command:

```bash
  ssh dokku@photogram.com ps:restart photogram
```

## Finishing up

### Create a superuser

Finally you may wish to add a superuser to access the Django admin. In Dokku there is `run` command which allows you to execute arbitrary commands within the running container:

```bash
  ssh -t dokku@photogram.com -- run photogram ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

Note the `-t` flag: we need to run this command with `tty` as it is interactive (Django will query you for username, email etc). You should use this syntax for any interactive commands, for example if you want to run the Python or Django shell.
