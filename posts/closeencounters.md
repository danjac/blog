![Close Encounters](/img/close-encounters-poster.jpg)

**Close Encounters of the Third Kind** (1977) is one Stephen Spielberg's earliest films, and following in the path of **Jaws** (1975) planted the director as the king of blockbusters (perhaps sharing the title with his friend and sometime collaborator George Lucas) for the next decade and beyond.

It's hard to find a film that so captures the zeitgeist of the late Seventies as Close Encounters.
