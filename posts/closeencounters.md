**Close Encounters of the Third Kind** (1977) is one Stephen Spielberg's earliest films, and following in the path of *Jaws* (1975) planted the director as the king of blockbusters (perhaps sharing the title with his friend and sometime collaborator George Lucas) for the next decade and beyond.

It's hard to find a film that so captures the zeitgeist of the late Seventies as *Close Encounters*. As a kid growing up in the UK, one of the favorite books on my shelf was Usborne's [World of the Unknown: UFOs](https://wearethemutants.com/2018/07/17/usbornes-world-of-the-unknown-ufos-1977/) which came out in the same year as Close Encounters. This book was part of a series which included monsters (Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and so on) and ghosts, but the one on UFOs was my personal favorite. I became a local expert on the Roswell crash, the Socorro egg, and the Hopkinsville Goblin. Of course I believed the theories of Erich von DÃ¤niken that aliens built the pyramids of Egypt and drew the Nazca lines of Peru, and that Project Blue Book was a government cover-up. The Bermuda Triangle held a particular fear and fascination for children at the time - any plane or boat travelling from Miami to the Bahamas wwas in danger of being snatched by a passing UFO or sucked into the depths of the ocean by a mysterious vortex (the Bermuda Triangle, of course, has some passing references in this film).

Belief in the UFOs went hand-in-hand in this period with a fascination for all things occult and paranormal. Films such as *The Exorcist*, *The Omen* and *Carrie* scared audiences with Satanism, witchcraft and psychic powers; TV shows presented by such serious figures from science fiction as Arthur C Clarke and Leonard Nimoy talked of ancient aliens long before it was a History Channel meme and gravely posed the question of whether the Sasquatch was real over grainy footage of what appeared to be a man in Chewbacca cosplay sitting on a log. In those halcyon pre-Internet days we pored over books and magazines covering subject matter from psychic auras to Tarot cards to spontaneous combustion.

*Close Encounters* not only played into the paranormal craze but another mood of the times, particularly in the United States. The Watergate hearings and the Vietnam War had ended a few short years before. Americans, particularly the younger generation, had lost trust in their government and conspiracy theories, previously the domain of the lone nutter and John Birch Society newsletter subscriber, went mainstream. Films such as *The Parallax View*, *Network* and *12 Days of the Condor* implied that the government was manipulated from behind the scenes by a shadowy cabal. In *Close Encounters* the US military and UN create a cover story while secretly in contact with the aliens. It's unclear what their motivations are, but unlike the extraterrestrials they do not appear benign.
