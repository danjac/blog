**Close Encounters of the Third Kind** (1977) is one Stephen Spielberg's earliest films, and following in the path of **Jaws** (1975) planted the director as the king of blockbusters (perhaps sharing the title with his friend and sometime collaborator George Lucas) for the next decade and beyond.

It's hard to find a film that so captures the zeitgeist of the late Seventies as Close Encounters. As a kid growing up in the UK, one of the favorite books on my shelf was Usborne's [World of the Unknown: UFOs](https://wearethemutants.com/2018/07/17/usbornes-world-of-the-unknown-ufos-1977/) which came out in the same year as Close Encounters. This book was part of a series which included one on monsters (Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and so on) and ghosts, but the one on UFOs was my personal favorite. I became a local expert on the Roswell crash, the Socorro egg, and the Hopkinsville Goblin. Of course I believed the theories of Erich von DÃ¤niken that aliens built the pyramids of Egypt and drew the Nazca lines of Peru, and that Project Blue Book was a cover-up and whitewash. I was terrified that one day I'd inadvertently book a flight over the Bermuda Triangle and be never seen again.
